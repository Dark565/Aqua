## What is Aqua? How it it constructed? Why it is fluid?
### This question was in human minds for centuries, until finally they discovered, that it is created with 2 atoms of hydrogen and 1 atom of oxygen.<br>Isn't it beautiful?

Aqua system works similarly. There is one main atom - kernel and other atoms are just connected with it.
Other atoms are device drivers and user programs, because Aqua is microkernel.

We write it in C with C11 standard and want to create kernel which will be able to run own programs and even graphical desktop environment.
Everything is written for fun and we all learn from our errors.
Our team are created of hobby programmers and artists, who program, make a music and draw graphics. You also can join us!
